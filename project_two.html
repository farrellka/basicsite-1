  <h1>My name is Kerri.</h1>
    <h2>I'm a professional writer and editor in higher education.</h2>
<p>In a former life (ok, four years ago) I was an academic. Now, I have several years of experience in university communications, with a specialty in development writing. In my spare time, I proofread and edit for friends and clients, as well as assist in the writing of a variety of projects - wedding toasts, invitations, sensitive e-mails, you name it.</p>
  <br>
    <p>With a little information on what you're looking for, I can help you, too.</p>
  <h4>You can find examples of my professional writing <a href="http://alumni.brandeis.edu/news-publications/news-archive/avalon.html"> here</a> and <a href="http://alumni.brandeis.edu/news-publications/news-archive/giving-beller.html"> here</a>.</h4>
